<Notes>
Opps, I am not actually going to show you how to TDD

I really wanted to, but I just couldn't find something worthy of showing!

<div
  style={{
    width: "50vw",
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    alignItems: "flexStart",

  <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
    <li>
      <h4 style={{ margin: 0 }}>Test Driven Development</h4>
      <p>
        A software development process where by the developer must first write a
        test, see that it fails, then write code to pass the test. This is
        repeated until functional.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<Notes>
  In case some of you have not yet heard of TDD here is my lousy defenition.
  Please take some time to enjoy this slide, I am really proud of the styling :p

# Research 📝

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>How many of you write React?</li>
    <li>How many of you TDD?</li>
    <li>How many of you just lied about doing TDD?</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
    Make sure to ask directly how may people TDD React and otherwise.

    If you did just fib about doing TDD don't worry! I have only recently come to terms with my own short comings in this area and I am here to talk to you about how that is ok!

# TDD doesn't make you a good developer

<Notes>Conversly, not doing it doesn't make you a bad developer!</Notes>

# Outline 🗺

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>There are no rules, only principles</li>
    <li>Testing categories are really an academic notion</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  Talk about what I look for in talks, opinions, so that is what I looked for
  and here are some opinions! get ready, please disagree with me! <br />
  1. Things I learned while researching for this talk <br />
  1. There are no rules only principles <br />
  2. Testing categories are an academic notion <br />
  3. Don't be too hard on yourself. <br />
  2. What are the principles? <br />
  3. Why no categories (unit, integration, e2e)? <br />
  1. I think these actually get in the way of testing your application properly
