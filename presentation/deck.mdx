# How to TDD in React

<Notes>
  How many of you were looking forward to hearing about this?
  <br /> Anyone looking to get some super knowledgeble insight on how best to do
  TDD?

Opps, I am not actually going to show you how to TDD

I really wanted to, but I just couldn't find something worthy of showing!

# How to Think About TDD in React

  but then that is way to long,.. noone would want to go to that. so HA tricked
  you. please don't leave I think in the end this is actually really help with
  HOW you tdd

      <p>
        A software development process where by the developer must first write a
        test, see that it fails, then write code to pass the test. This is
        repeated until functional.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<Notes>
  In case some of you have not yet heard of TDD here is my lousy defenition.
  Please take some time to enjoy this slide, I am really proud of the styling :p
</Notes>

# Last Minute Research :pencil:

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>How many of you write React?</li>
    <li>How many of you TDD?</li>
    <li>How many of you just lied about doing TDD?</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
    Make sure to ask directly how may people TDD React and otherwise.

    If you did just fib about doing TDD don't worry! I have only recently come to terms with my own short comings in this area and I am here to talk to you about how that is ok!

</Notes>

# Side Note

# TDD doesn't make you a good developer

<Notes>Conversly, not doing it doesn't make you a bad developer!</Notes>

# Claims 🗺

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>There are no rules, only principles</li>
    <li>Testing categories are really an academic notion</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  Talk about what I look for in talks, opinions, so that is what I looked for
  and here are some opinions! get ready, please disagree with me!

<br />

what is going to guide what you test. ultimatly that will the question when we think about testing in React

</Notes>

---

# Question:

## What Should We Test?

<Notes>

This talk is really all about...

</Notes>

---

# How It All Started

<Notes>
  I wanted to do a talk on TDD, so I wanted to make sure that I had good quality
  information to share with you and not just my naive opinions. So I went to the
  internet and began searching<br/>

as if people didn't know how to use the internet and I was the only way to communicat the good things people where saying about testing in react

</Notes>

---

# I Like Two Things

---

# Opinions

<Notes> Real strong ones </Notes>

---

# Rules

<ul style={{ padding: 0 }}>
  <Appear>
    <li style={{ listStyle: "none", textAlign: "center" }}>
      they are endlessly reproducible
    </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

I like math, I like rules, they are endlessly reproducible. Once you understand them you can repeat with little cognative involvement

</Notes>

# I Wanted the _"Prettier"_ of TDD

<Notes>
  Who knows what prettier is? <br />I wanted an opinion that I could just
  follow! GIMMY THE RULES
</Notes>

# TDD without React

<ul style={{ padding: 0 }}>
  <Appear>
    <li style={{ listStyle: "none", textAlign: "center" }}>It's hard.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  I found extremely difficult to learn to test and practice TDD. But this is now
  HTML/CSS, it's different
</Notes>

---

<Image src="./images/1.carbon.svg" />

<Notes>
  we know exactly what we want the outcome to be. <br />
  <br />
  we know how we are developing it for
  <br />
  <br />
  example 1.js
</Notes>

---

## React Testing Feels like testing HTML/CSS

Application structure and astetics

<Notes>
  Now don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with that! But we need to frame
  that question a little differently
</Notes>

---

# WAIT!

<Notes>
  React is obviously much more that just html and css but there other stuff is
  just JS and we know how to test that, it has more defined rules! That type of
  testing has been around for longer
</Notes>

---

# Trial and Errror

<Notes>
  Someone here tell me how you developed in raw html css? how did you TDD that?{" "}
  <br />
  There really is no pattern, no structure? <br />
  there is but it is assumed with time and experience
  <br />
  <br />
  can you image writing an entire web application without looking at it? Just the
  code!
</Notes>

# React felt like _"Code"_

<Notes>
  This is going to seem like an odd statement, let me try and explain
  <br />

Let's go back to our sum function

# Who Are We Creating This For?

---

<Image src="./images/1.carbon.svg" />

<Notes>
  Who are we creating this for?
  <br />
  <br /> there is only one interface this can get used.
  <br />
  <br />
  unless we are talking about a calculator 🤔
</Notes>

---

<Image src="./images/2.carbon.svg" />

---

<Image src="./images/3.carbon.svg" />

<Notes>This even looks like code! So we should test it like code, right?</Notes>

---

# Who is the Audience?

<Notes>
  {" "}
  go and look at the example app <br />
  <br /> then go back to the class and ask what do we need to test for
  developers?{" "}
</Notes>

---

# Choose a Focus

---

# User / Developer

<Notes>
  Library
  <br />
  <br />
  let's for the remainder of this talk use the Users as our focus, because we know
  how to test code
</Notes>

# Focus on the End User

# My Experience

<Notes>
  {" "}
  I used to think about what can be unit tested. I thought of that as my
  philosophy, so I really couldn't find anything that WASN'T worth testing.
  Everything passed my conditions so everything got unit tested and before I
  knew it I was bogged down fixing and updating unit tests for ever iteration.
  Testing took up 60% of the work and it was work I really didn't want to
  do.Test burnout is real!
